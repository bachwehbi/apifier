APIfier
=======

Generator of REST API code (client and server sides) from simple and intuitive description that needs just few minutes to learn.

    This is an early proof of concept! Do not use for any serious work :)

Still interested to see it in action (I warned you ;)

## TODOs
* Improve API description language
* Generate server side code (Node.js to start with)
* Ensure this is really working :)
* Documentation
